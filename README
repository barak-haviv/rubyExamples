Ruby Cookbook Source README
by Leonard Richardson (leonardr@segfault.org)
Last update: 09/06/2006

This source code was extracted automatically from my markup copy of
the Ruby Cookbook. Every chapter has its own directory, and every
recipe (and chapter introduction) has its own file.

A recipe's file contains the text of that recipe that the book
presents as code. This may not all be Ruby code. Some recipes contain
SQL, XML, shell commands, or C code. Sections of code (separated, in
the book, by text), are here separated by a comment that looks like
this:

#---

The code is from the pre-edit final draft. Thus, there are several
changes between the code contained here and what you see in the
book. I don't know where these changes are but I'm fairly sure they're
all minor. Let me know if you find any.

I've skimmed this presentation of the code to check for obvious
problems, but there may be code in the book that didn't get extracted
by my script. Again, let me know if you have any problems with the
code.

This code incorporates fixes for the two errata published on
O'Reilly's site as of July 17, 2006: "Query strings in fetched URLs
are stripped (14.3, 14.20)" and "No need to override Logger::Formatter
to change the log format (17.5)".
